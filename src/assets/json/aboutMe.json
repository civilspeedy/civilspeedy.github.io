  "bio": [
    "I am a student currently awaiting my dissertation results from Bournemouth University. I am experienced in various programming languages, and keen to learn more. Currently, I am teaching myself Rust to explore the memory safety and performance offered. It is a unique learning experience as most of my programming has been in high-level languages, but ultimately I'm finding the challenge an enjoyable and engaging aspect of the learning process.",
    "I am also interested in areas outside of software engineering. I have a strong passion for media creation, such as film production, graphic design and photography. I also enjoy travelling and exploring the world and am not one to shy away from physical tasks and getting out of my comfort zone. "
