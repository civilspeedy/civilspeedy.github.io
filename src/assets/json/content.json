      "I am currently searching for my first industry job having completed my final year at Bournemouth University for Software Engineering (Ba Hons), with a 2:1 overall and a 1st for my dissertation. During my time at Bournemouth University, I have become familiar with numerous web and software development practices. Units like “Ubiquitous Computing” have given me great experience in designing any application be it web or on-device. I am also able to draw on creative skills learnt during my Media Studies and Photography A-levels, giving me a skill set that is both technical and creative.",
      "I am also interested in areas outside of software engineering. I have a strong passion for media creation, such as film production, graphic design and photography. I also enjoy travelling and exploring the world and am not one to shy away from physical tasks and getting out of my comfort zone."
